About

I'm Robert, a natural sciences student at the University of Cambridge. I am interested
in a broad range of quantitative topics, including physics, statistics, finance and
computer science (and the intersection between them). For more about me, please head
over to my `website <https://reasonabledeviations.science>`_.

I learn fastest when making real projects. A few months back I began seriously trying
to self-educate on certain topics in quantitative finance, and mean-variance
optimisation is one of the cornerstones of this field. I read quite a few journal
articles and explanations but ultimately felt that a real proof of understanding would
lie in the implementation. At the same time, I realised that existing open-source
(python) portfolio optimisation libraries (there are one or two), were unsatisfactory
for a number of reasons, and that people 'out there' might benefit from a
well-documented and intuitive API. This is what motivated the development of
PyPortfolioOpt.
